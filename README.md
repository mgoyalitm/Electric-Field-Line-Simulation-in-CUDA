## Overview
This project simulates the motion of charged particles and their electric field lines using **CUDA parallel computation**. The simulation is rendered in real time with **OpenGL graphics** and includes immersive 3D sound effects via **OpenAL**, where particle properties are mapped to audio characteristics.
